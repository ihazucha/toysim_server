# Recreating an Ackermann Vehicle in Unreal Engine 5

## Key Parameters to Measure

For a basic Ackermann model vehicle, focus on these fundamental parameters:

### Physical Dimensions
- Wheelbase (distance between front and rear axles)
- Track width (distance between left and right wheels)
- Vehicle mass
- Center of gravity height and position

### Steering Geometry
- Maximum steering angle for inner/outer wheels
- Ackermann angle ratio (difference in steering angle between inner/outer wheels in turns)
- Turning radius at full lock

### Performance Characteristics
- Maximum acceleration
- Maximum braking deceleration
- Top speed
- Drivetrain type (FWD/RWD/AWD)

## Data Collection Process

1. **Physical Measurements:**
   - Use calipers/measuring tape for wheelbase and track width
   - Use a scale to determine mass
   - Mark center of mass through balance tests

2. **Steering Behavior:**
   - Mark steering angles at full lock (use protractor)
   - Measure turning radius (trace the arc of the outer wheels at full lock)

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - Record acceleration runs (0-max speed)
   - Measure braking distance from different speeds
   - Record steering response during turns

## Implementing in Unreal Engine 5

1. **Set Up Vehicle Framework:**
   ```cpp
   // Use UE5's Chaos Vehicle system as starting point
   // Configure basic vehicle dimensions in the vehicle blueprint
   ```

2. **Configure Ackermann Steering:**
   - Use UE5's built-in Ackermann steering model
   - Set toe angle, steering angle limits, and Ackermann compensation

3. **Basic Tuning Parameters:**
   - Vehicle mass and dimensions
   - Engine torque curve
   - Transmission gear ratios 
   - Steering sensitivity

## Objective Evaluation

1. **Create Test Scenarios:**
   - Straight-line acceleration test
   - Braking distance test
   - Figure-8 test for steering behavior
   - Slalom test for responsive handling

2. **Record Metrics:**
   - Time to reach specific speeds
   - Braking distance
   - Turning radius at various speeds
   - Trajectory comparison

3. **Automatic Evaluation System:**
   ```cpp
   // Create a metrics collector class
   class VehicleMetricsCollector
   {
       // Record real-world vs simulation values
       // Calculate error metrics (e.g., RMSE)
       // Generate fitness score based on weighted parameters
   }
   ```

4. **Visualization:**
   - Plot real vs simulated acceleration curves
   - Display trajectory overlays of real vs simulated paths
   - Calculate and display error percentages for key metrics

## Iterative Tuning Approach

1. Start with basic dimensions and mass
2. Tune steering geometry to match turning radius
3. Adjust power and drivetrain parameters to match acceleration
4. Fine-tune to match cornering behavior
5. Use a weighted error function to prioritize which parameters need more adjustment

This approach focuses on the core parameters while providing an objective way to measure how closely your simulation matches the real model vehicle.
